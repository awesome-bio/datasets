It maintains the critical relationship between projects, cases, clinical data and molecular data and insures that this data is linked correctly to the actual data file objects themselves, by means of unique identifiers.","Different data comes in different file formats, e.g., XML, TXT, PDF, CEL, IDAT, tab-delimited TXT, BAM, VCF, TSV, SCF, TR, DCM, FSA, CEL, TIFF, see more.","API, files.

Users can access information stored in the GDC Data Model using the GDC Data Portal, the GDC API, and the GDC Data Transfer Tool. For more information see Data Access Processes and Tools.

The GDC API drives the GDC Data and Submission Portals and provides programmatic access to GDC functionality. This includes searching for, downloading, and submitting data and metadata. The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

Raw data (e.g. BAMs), germline and non-validated mutations, and genotypes are under controlled access. Derived data is available open access (there are some exceptions, see more).

In case of controlled access, dbGaP authorization and eRA Commons authentication are necessary for access.","The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - which is used by Kronos and BioSynapse would like to use - is a SUBSET of this dataset

Some of these acquired alterations represent compelling therapeutic targets. The challenge is that, for the overwhelming majority of cancers, we do not fully understand the relationship between the genetic alterations of cancer and the dependencies they cause. To solve this problem, we are creating a “cancer dependency map” by systematically identifying genetic dependencies and small molecule sensitivities and discovering the biomarkers that predict them.

DepMap scientists are profiling hundreds of cancer cell line models for genomic information and sensitivity to genetic and small molecule perturbations. By triangulating information from these and other large-scale datasets, the hope is to define a landscape of genetic targets for therapeutic development, identify patients who respond to these therapies, and develop a better understanding of the vulnerabilities of cancer.

The goal is to conduct a detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel of human cancer models, to develop integrated computational analyses that link distinct pharmacologic vulnerabilities to genomic patterns and to translate cell line integrative genomics into cancer patient stratification. Later the MD Anderson and Harvard Medical school joined the project. As of summer of 2018 CCLE continues its efforts as part of the Broad Cancer Dependency Map Project.

,COSMIC,,,https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/about,"COSMIC comprises the COSMIC database and the Cell Lines Project, two separate but related resources.

The COSMIC database combines two main types of data:

High Precision Data, Manually Curated by Experts:
 - Targeted gene-screening panels
 - Over 27,000 peer reviewed papers
 - Metadata (environmental factors and patient history)
 - Focused on known and suspected cancer genes and mutations
 - Objective frequency data as a result of mutation negative samples
 - Full details of the curation process and data captured

Genome-wide Screen Data:
 - Over 37,000 genomes, consisting of:
 - peer reviewed large scale genome screening data
 - other databases such as TCGA and ICGC
 - Provides unbiased, genome-level profiling of diseases
 - Objective frequency data, by interpreting non-mutant genes across each genome

,Open FDA,,,https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/drugsfda/,"openFDA is the first innovation created by Taha Kass-Hout, MD, MS, upon joining FDA as the first Chief Health Information Officer in March 2013. The goal of the project is to create easy access to public data, to create a new level of openness and accountability, to ensure the privacy and security of public FDA data, and ultimately to educate the public and save lives. The concept was to index high-value, high priority and scalable public-access data, format and document that data in developer and consumer-friendly standards, and make that data available via a public-access portal that enables developers to quickly and easily use it in applications. Dr. Kass-Hout launched the project by obtaining a Presidential Innovation Fellow to focus on policy and programmatic issues in July 2013. The public cloud environment was determined in September 2013, and Dr. Kass-Hout's team solicited agency and user input into policies, first priority datasets, and desirable technical characteristics of openFDA.
