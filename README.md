# Datasets

We’re thrilled you’ve decided to contribute to standardizing some of the most commonly used publicly available datasets in bio. Data is the raw energy source for all bio-projects/startups/efforts - but whereas there’s a lot of it in the public domain - it’s not uniformly documented, formatted, and distributed (making it hard to leverage without a large engineering team - or serious money to spend on paywalled platforms). This is the problem we’re tackling - build a better basic infrastructure, out in the open, and empower all the folks out there with cool ideas or applications that can ride on top.

Once we’ve completed this basic documentation, the next step will be to build pipelines to sustainably source these datasets, and cast them into a modern format that will be easy for follow-on developers to use.
